## ぐっちゃん 🌟,


*クリスのすきなやつ？ アニメ？*
    <cite>ぐっちゃん</cite>

    Does I like Anime? Yes, I think Anime has done a good job talking about living in the world of uncertainty.
    When I was a child I watched
        - [Voltron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltron)
        - [Thundercats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThunderCats_(1985_TV_series))
        - [Dragon Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball)
        - [Dragon Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z)
        - [Pokemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(TV_series))

    It lead me to wanting to study Japanese and to visit Japan. This was a big challenge for me since I was from America.
    I had no Japanese Friends or much money. So I decided to look for ways to make money.
